CMP_SC/INFOTC 3330 - Object-Oriented Programming
Group Assignment #1
Study Room Reservations
Spring 2026
Scenario
The campus library has a small number of study rooms. Students can reserve a room for a one hour
time slot. The librarians want a tiny Java program to track reservations and help them manage
check ins.
You will design and implement a small object oriented program that models this system. Cor-
rectness matters, but design quality matters just as much. Your solution should reflect clear
responsibilities, good encapsulation, and responsible collaboration between objects.
Required Software
Below have hyperlinks, so just click on them to get to the download pages.
• Eclipse IDE (Latest version: 2025-12)(Recommended) or IntelliJ IDEA
• Java SE Development Kit 25.0.2 (JDK25)
Allowed Topics and Constraints
Stay within what we have covered so far:
• Classes, fields, methods, constructors, access modifiers
• Encapsulation and class invariants (fail fast validation)
• Object relationships (association, composition) and collaboration
• Law of Demeter (avoid long chains and knowledge leaks)
• Basic arrays are allowed
Do NOT use:
• Java Collections Framework (no List, ArrayList, etc.)
• Inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism

• Overriding or implementing equals
• Static fields for application state
• User input (no scanner required). Hardcode a demonstration in Main.
Submission Instructions
• Export your Java project as .zip or .rar file through the IDE. Don’t zip it externally through
other programs.
• Submit your exported Java project through Canvas, and make sure all .java source files are
included in your exported project.
• Your code must compile and run
• While submitting, you must specify which IDE you used. You can write it in a README file.
• Only Eclipse (Recommended) or IntelliJ is allowed for the IDE.
• Submit screenshots of your running output. You can add the screenshots into your project,
but not where your source files, or packages are. Create a new folder in your project, and you
can call it screeshots and store them into that folder.
Academic Integrity
Use of AI tools is strictly prohibited for this assignment.
Any use of AI generated code, design, or explanations will be reported to the Academic Integrity
Office.
What You Are Building
Your system must support:
• Creating rooms (example: Room 101, capacity 4)
• Creating reservations for a specific room, student name, and time slot
• Check in: mark a reservation as checked in
• Cancel: cancel a reservation
• Simple reporting: print reservations for a room or print all reservations
To avoid equals, you will use integer IDs to identify reservations.
Required Classes
You must implement at least these classes:

Room
Represents a study room.
Required data:
• String roomName (example: "Room 101")
• int capacity (must be positive)
Required behavior:
• Constructor enforces invariants (fail fast)
• Getters as needed (use intentionally)
• A toString() that prints a meaningful description (example: Room 101 (cap 4))
Design note: Consider making Room immutable.
TimeSlot
Represents a one hour slot.
Required data:
• int hour where 0 to 23
Required behavior:
• Constructor validates hour (fail fast)
• toString() such as 13:00-14:00combine it with ternary operator to add AM and PM for
the time
Design note: This is a great candidate for an immutable class.
Reservation
Represents a reservation for one student in one room at one time slot.
Required data:
• int id (must be positive)
• Room room
• String studentName (not null or blank)
• TimeSlot timeSlot
• boolean canceled
• boolean checkedIn
Required invariants:
• id > 0
• room and timeSlot are not null

• studentName is not null or blank
• A reservation cannot be both canceled and checked in at the same time
Required behavior:
• Constructor validates invariants (fail fast)
• cancel() marks the reservation canceled if allowed
• checkIn() marks the reservation checked in if allowed
• Methods that answer questions such as isActive() or canCheckIn() are encouraged
• toString() prints a useful line including id, student, room, time slot, and status
Open design choice: Decide what should happen if a reservation is checked in after being
canceled, or canceled after being checked in. You must pick a rule and enforce it consistently.
ReservationBook
This class stores reservations and owns them. It should not coordinate the whole application, it
should manage reservation storage and basic queries.
Constraints: You must store reservations using a plain Java array, for example:
• private Reservation[] reservations;
• private int count;
Required behavior:
• Constructor creates an empty book with a fixed maximum capacity (positive)
• add(Reservation r) adds if space exists, otherwise throws an exception
• findById(int id) returns the matching reservation or null if not found
• printAll() prints all stored reservations (one per line)
• printForRoom(Room room) prints reservations for that room
Design requirements:
• Fields must be private
• Do not expose the internal array directly
• Keep methods focused. Avoid turning this into a god class. Make findById method recursive.
Open design choice: Decide whether printForRoom compares rooms by name, by reference,
or by another approach, without using equals. Document your choice in a short comment.

ReservationManager
Coordinates the system at a higher level. Make an exception for this class and make it a God class.
Required behavior:
• Stores a ReservationBook Make exception store and own all other classes as well.
• Generates reservation IDs (you can use a private counter field)
• Provides high level operations such as:
– createReservation(Room room, String studentName, TimeSlot slot)
– cancelReservation(int id)
– checkInReservation(int id)
Design requirements:
• Avoid reaching through objects to manipulate internals
• Avoid long chains like a.getB().getC().doSomething()
• Delegate behavior to the class that owns the relevant data
Main
Your Main must demonstrate functionality with hardcoded data.
Minimum demo requirements:
• Create at least 2 rooms
• Create at least 5 reservations across different rooms and time slots
• Cancel at least 1 reservation
• Check in at least 1 reservation
• Print all reservations
• Print reservations for one specific room
Deliverables
Submit:
• Room.java
• TimeSlot.java
• Reservation.java
• ReservationBook.java
• ReservationManager.java
• Main.java

Grading Rubric (40 points total)
1. Correctness and Required Features (12 points)
• All required classes compile and run (3 points)
• Reservation creation works and stores reservations (3 points)
• Cancel and check in operations work correctly (3 points)
• Printing functions produce meaningful output (3 points)
2. Encapsulation and Invariants (10 points)
• Fields are private, internal state is protected (3 points)
• Constructors validate inputs and enforce invariants (4 points)
• No unnecessary setters or direct state exposure (3 points)
3. Object Relationships and Collaboration (8 points)
• Appropriate relationships: ReservationBook owns reservations, reservations refer to room and
timeslot responsibly (3 points)
• Responsibilities are placed in the right class (3 points)
• Follows Law of Demeter, avoids knowledge leaks and long chains (2 points)
4. Design Quality and Code Smell Avoidance (6 points)
• No god class (manager coordinates, book stores, reservation owns its status rules) (2 points)
• Avoids anemic objects: Reservation has meaningful behavior, not just getters (2 points)
• Excessive void method usage and relying on mutable objects. Methods should all be testable.
Print methods can be void. (2 points)
5. Readability and Naming (4 points)
• Clear naming and consistent formatting (2 points)
• Well-commented methods, describing the behavior (2 points)
Notes to Students
There are multiple valid designs. You will be graded on how well your design follows object-oriented
principles and how consistently you enforce your own rules.
